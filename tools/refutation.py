BugWolf Adversarial Refutation Engine v1.0.0

Core rule: never trust a finding on its own word.

Spawns an adversarial model (different from the discovering agent) with one
objective: "You win if you kill this finding." Runs the 4-gate evaluation
(Refutation → Reachability → Trigger → Impact) from references/judging.md.
Only what survives all four gates is confirmed.

Usage:
  python3 tools/refutation.py --target example.com --finding-id abc123
  python3 tools/refutation.py --target example.com --all
  python3 tools/refutation.py --finding-file findings.jsonl --passes 3

GATE 2 — REACHABILITY: Can the vulnerable state exist in a live deployment?
  KILL if: structurally impossible (invariant prevents it).
  DEMOTE if: requires unusual privileged actions.
  CLEAR if: achievable through normal usage.

GATE 3 — TRIGGER: Can an unprivileged actor execute profitably?
