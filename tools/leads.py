BugWolf Lead Ledger — persistent state-transition research objects for OPEN LEADs.

An OPEN LEAD is no longer a one-line journal entry that gets dropped when the
session ends. Every unresolved lead is a persisted object that lives across
sessions and mutates one variable at a time until its impact becomes provable.

Lead lifecycle (state machine):

    OPEN ──► MUTATING ──► FINDING   (both halves proven → promoted to findings.jsonl)
     │          │
     │          └──────────► PARKED (impact not provable under current preconditions
     │                                   → stays alive in the chain pool)
     └──────────────────────► PARKED (kill refused: only one half refuted)
     │
     └──► KILLED (ONLY with BOTH refutations recorded with evidence)

Guarantees:
  - Kill guard: kill_lead() REFUSES unless BOTH the trigger half AND the impact
    half are refuted with evidence strings. A refusal auto-parks the lead into
    the chain pool instead of dropping it. Dismissal attempts are counted.
  - Preconditions: every unprovable half is decomposed into named
    preconditions (missing account, role, state, timing window, sibling
    endpoint, chain partner...). Each resolves to present/missing/refuted.
  - One-variable mutation loop: mutate_lead() records exactly one variable
    change (old → new → result → evidence) per attempt. next_mutation()
    deterministically picks the first missing precondition whose exact
    (variable, value) pair was never tried, so agents never repeat a dead
    experiment and never mutate two variables at once.
  - Chain pool: PARKED leads are not dead. find_chain_partners() re-scans
    findings AND parked leads so a parked lead can become the missing half of
    a later A→B breakthrough.
  - Persistence: state/sessions/{target}/leads.jsonl — append-only full
    snapshots; the last line per lead_id is the current state, so the history
    of every state transition is itself the tamper-evident research log.
