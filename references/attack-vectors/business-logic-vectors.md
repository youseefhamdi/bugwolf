# Business Logic Attack Vectors

## State Machine
- Skip workflow state (pending → completed without approved)
- Replay completed transition
- Reverse completed action to recover assets
- Concurrent state transitions (two users advancing the same state)
- Email confirmation bypass: change email → confirmation goes to old email → full account takeover
- OAuth account linking abuse: link attacker's OAuth to victim's primary account

## Limits & Caps
- Rate limit bypass (IP headers, parallel accounts)
- Allowance decrement race (TOCTOU)
- Max withdrawal split into sub-limit chunks
- KYC/tier step skip via direct API call
- GraphQL batching to bypass rate limits (1000 queries in one request)

## Payments & Deposits
- Negative or zero amount accepted
- Price captured at order time, fulfilled at different price
- Coupon stacking beyond intended limits
- Refund + retain resource
- Token type mismatch in deposit/withdrawal
- In-flight payment data modification to payment provider
- CD key / license key extraction via API enumeration

## Rewards & Incentives
- Self-referral across accounts
- Circular referral chain
- Double-claim via revert/reset
- Airdrop Sybil: multiple wallets, one entity

## Cross-Feature
- Deprecated endpoint bypasses new validation
- Webhook triggers privileged action when crafted
- Import/export bypasses create/update validation
- Feature A state consumed by Feature B without validation
- Project import: path traversal in file copy → arbitrary file read
- Git repository import: malicious filename with git flags → file overwrite → RCE
- Template rendering: SSTI via email templates, markdown renderers

## Identity & Account
- Account merge to combine limits
- Delete + re-register to reset flags
- Pending action hijack (token not bound to requesting account)
- Email case sensitivity: two accounts for same address
- Phone number recycling (carrier reassigns numbers)
- Email confirmation bypass: system sends confirmation to current email instead of new email → SSO takeover
- OAuth linking: link attacker's OAuth provider to victim's account → access victim's data
- Password reset without user interaction: direct reset link generation
